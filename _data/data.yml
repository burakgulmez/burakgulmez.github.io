    title: About me
    summary: |
      My research interests span a wide range of cutting-edge areas in artificial intelligence and operations research. I'm particularly focused on metaheuristic algorithms, machine learning, deep learning, and their applications in big data analysis, transportation, and multi-objective optimization. These fields allow me to combine theoretical advancements with practical problem-solving.
      In my career, I've had the opportunity to work in diverse academic settings. Currently, I'm serving as an Associate Professor in Industrial Engineering (English) at Mudanya University in Türkiye. Prior to this, I completed a postdoctoral research position at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University in the Netherlands, which followed my role as a Research Assistant at Erciyes University in Türkiye.
      My educational background includes a Ph.D. and a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering from Erciyes University, and a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering (English) from Hacettepe University. 
      I've been fortunate to gain international experience through various mobility programs. These include my postdoctoral research at Leiden University, summer schools at the University of Jyvaskyla in Finland, and a visiting researcher position at the University of Granada in Spain. These experiences have broadened my perspective and enhanced my collaborative skills in an international research environment.
      Throughout my career, I've been involved in several significant projects. These range from developing explainable AI for multi-criteria optimization to creating smart maintenance systems using deep learning. I've also worked on optimizing vehicle routing for shared taxi applications and solving complex scheduling problems in rail systems.
      In terms of technical skills, I'm proficient in various programming languages and tools essential for my research. These include Python, C#, Java, as well as specialized software like Minitab, Gurobi, and IBM CPLEX. These skills enable me to implement complex algorithms and conduct thorough data analyses in my research projects.
