    title: About me
    summary: |
      My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and operations research, with a particular focus on metaheuristic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning. I apply these techniques to solve complex problems in big data analysis, transportation, and multi-objective optimization. My international experience includes postdoctoral research at Leiden University in the Netherlands, summer schools at the University of Jyvaskyla in Finland, and a visiting researcher position at the University of Granada in Spain. These experiences have enhanced my collaborative skills and broadened my research perspective. Technically, I'm proficient in Python, C#, and Java, as well as specialized software like Minitab, Gurobi, and IBM CPLEX, which I use to implement complex algorithms and conduct thorough data analyses in my research projects.
